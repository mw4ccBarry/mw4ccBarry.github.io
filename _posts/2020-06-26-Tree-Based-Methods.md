Overview
==========
**Segment the predictor space** into a number of regions and use the **mean or mode of the observations in the region** for prediction. The segment/spliting rules can be summarized in a tree so the method is named as decision tree methods.


**Advantages:**
- Interpretability
- Visualization
- Mirror people's thinking process
- Handle qualitative predictors


**Disadvantages:**
- non-robust
- performance


**Some concepts need to know:** terminal node, leaf, internal node, branch, root node, splitting, pruning


Wide used algorithms: ID3


Regression Tree
==========
The book introduce the recursive binary splitting which is a top-down, greedy approach to build the decision tree. 

$$ e^{i \pi} = -1$$
