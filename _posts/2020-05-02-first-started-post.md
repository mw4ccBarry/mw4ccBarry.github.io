I would like to brief introduce why I make this personal site and take the notes here about how I did this for fureture refernece. We are using **Jekyll & Minimal Mistakes** so a big thanks [Minimal Mistakes!](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) For this site, I am going to use it to start to practice *front end web application work, track my thoughts and life and some part time projects*.
