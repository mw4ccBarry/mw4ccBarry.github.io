Linear Classiferers and Gradient Descent
=====

**Machine Learning** is the study of algorithms that:
- Improve their performance
- on some task(s)
- Based on expereince (typically data)
- **Supervised/Unsupervised/Reinforcement**:
    - Supervised Learning (Input Data and Label to get Learning Output)
    - Unsupervised Learning (Input Data and **NO** Label to get Learning Output)
    - Reinforcement Learning (Supervision in form of reward)
- **Non-Parametric Model/Paremetric Model**:
    - Non-parametric: No explict model for the function
        - Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree
    - Paremetric: Explicitly model the function in the form of a parametrized function
        - Logistic Regression, Neural Network


*Keyword*: Feature Engineering, High Dimention data to Low Dimention data   

**Components of a Parametric Learning Algorithm**
- Input/Representation
- Functional Form of the model (with parameters)
- Performance measure to improve
    - Loss or objective function
- Algorithm for finding best parameters
    - Optimization algorithm

*Keyword*: Linear Regression and Classification
